                    <p class="subtitle">SSL pinning (also known as certificate pinning) is a security technique used in mobile and web applications to help prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring the client connects only to a trusted server with a known SSL/TLS certificate.</p>

            <h2>What Problem Does SSL Pinning Solve?</h2>
            <p>Normally, during an HTTPS connection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The client (e.g., app or browser) connects to a server.</li>
                <li>The server provides its SSL/TLS certificate.</li>
                <li>The client verifies that the certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Problem: If an attacker can trick the device into trusting a malicious certificate (e.g., via rogue Wi-Fi, compromised CA, or custom root certificates), they can intercept and decrypt the traffic — a classic MITM attack.</p>

            <h2>How SSL Pinning Works</h2>
            <p>SSL pinning helps prevent this by "pinning" a specific certificate or public key to the client app.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The app has a copy of the expected server certificate or public key hardcoded or securely embedded.</li>
                <li>When connecting, the app checks that the server's certificate matches the pinned one.</li>
                <li>If it doesn’t match, the connection is rejected, even if the certificate is valid and signed by a trusted CA.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>Let’s say your app communicates with https://api.mybank.com.</p>
            <p>With SSL pinning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You pin the public key or certificate of api.mybank.com in your app.</li>
                <li>On every connection, the app compares the received certificate/key with the pinned one.</li>
                <li>If a MITM attacker presents a fake certificate (even one signed by a trusted CA), the app blocks the connection.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Types of Pinning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Certificate Pinning: Pins the entire server certificate.</li>
                <li>Public Key Pinning: Pins only the public key from the certificate.</li>
                <li>SPKI Pinning: A specific format of public key pinning using the Subject Public Key Info field.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Considerations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strong defense against MITM.</li>
                        <li>Works even if a CA is compromised or a custom CA is added to the device.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hardcoding certificates can cause outages if they expire or are rotated without app updates.</li>
                        <li>Must handle renewal or fallback strategies properly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Banking and finance apps</li>
                <li>Apps handling sensitive personal data</li>
                <li>Environments where devices might be rooted or tampered with</li>
