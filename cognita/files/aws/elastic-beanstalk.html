            <h2>What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?</h2>
            <p>In addition to web server environments, Elastic Beanstalk also provides worker environments which you can use to process messages from an Amazon SQS queue, useful for asynchronous or long-running tasks. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-tiers.html">Elastic Beanstalk worker environments</a>.</p>
            <p>Easily migrate, deploy, and scale full-stack applications on AWS.</p>

            <h2>Why Elastic Beanstalk?</h2>
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk enables customers to easily migrate, deploy, and scale full-stack applications. It manages application and infrastructure operations, letting developers focus on business logic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Use cases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Traditional web application migration
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many large enterprises need to migrate their existing monolithic applications such as .NET applications, Java applications, or PHP web services, from on-premises data centers or competitor platforms to the cloud without breaking apart or re-architecting their code. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a straightforward "lift and shift" path for these traditional applications, offering wide instance type support and customization options to integrate with other AWS services. This allows companies to move their existing code bases quickly while maintaining compatibility with legacy systems and gaining cloud benefits like auto-scaling and managed platform updates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simple container application hosting
                    <ul>
                        <li>Organizations running individual containers need simple deployment and management without complex container orchestration. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides teams with the ability to run Docker containers on EC2 instances with built-in scaling and infrastructure management. This allows different teams to deploy and manage their containerized applications independently without infrastructure expertise or operational overhead.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web application development
                    <ul>
                        <li>Organizations new to AWS need a simple way to deploy and run their applications without deep cloud expertise. AWS Elastic Beanstalk enables these customers to deploy applications by simply uploading their code, while the service automatically handles infrastructure provisioning, capacity scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring. It also manages platform updates and patching, allowing businesses to focus on their application code rather than infrastructure management.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Containerized Applications</h2>
            <p>Containerized applications are software applications that are packaged along with all their dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environments, making it easier to build, ship, and run applications reliably.</p>

            <h2>üö¢ What Is a Container?</h2>
            <p>A container is a standardized unit of software that packages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application code</li>
                <li>Runtime</li>
                <li>System tools and libraries</li>
                <li>Configuration files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Containers run on a container engine, the most common being Docker.</p>

            <h2>üß† Can You Use Both Together?</h2>
            <p>Yes! Elastic Beanstalk supports Docker containers. So, you can deploy a containerized app using Beanstalk if you want the convenience of managed services without using ECS or Kubernetes.</p>
            <p>üß™ Example: You build a Docker image of a Python web app and deploy it on Beanstalk using the "Docker" platform. Beanstalk manages the EC2 instances, scaling, and health monitoring, while you define your container.</p>

        <section>
            <p>When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in your AWS account to run your application.</p>
            <p>You can interact with Elastic Beanstalk through the Elastic Beanstalk console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the EB CLI, a high-level command line tool designed specifically for Elastic Beanstalk.</p>
            <p>You can perform most deployment tasks, such as changing the size of your fleet of Amazon EC2 instances or monitoring your application, directly from the Elastic Beanstalk web interface (console).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Application deploy workflow</h2>
            <p>To use Elastic Beanstalk, you create an application, then upload your application source bundle to Elastic Beanstalk.</p>
            <p>Next, you provide information about the application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically launches an environment and creates and configures the AWS resources needed to run your code.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p>There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk. You pay only for the underlying AWS resources that your application consumes.</p>
