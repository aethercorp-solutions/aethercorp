            <h2>Account Setup:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Account Setup:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You provide your email address, create a password, and choose an AWS account name.</li>
                        <li>You enter your personal or business information, including billing details.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Billing Information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AWS requires a valid credit card or payment method even if you only plan to use the free tier.</li>
                        <li>Your payment information is stored securely for future billing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Identity Verification:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AWS might verify your identity by sending a confirmation code via email or phone.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes, you may be asked to verify your phone number with an automated call or SMS.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Free Tier Access:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your account immediately gets access to the AWS Free Tier, which provides limited free usage of many AWS services for 12 months.</li>
                        <li>This is useful for trying out services without incurring costs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Root User Created:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You gain access to the AWS Management Console as the root user.</li>
                        <li>This root user has full administrative privileges and should be secured carefully.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    AWS Account ID and Resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your account is assigned a unique AWS Account ID.</li>
                        <li>You can start creating and managing AWS resources (servers, databases, storage, etc.) in your account.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    IAM (Identity and Access Management):
                    <ul>
                        <li>You should set up IAM users and roles to securely manage access permissions rather than using the root user for everyday tasks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Default Settings and Region:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You select a default AWS region where your resources will be deployed (though you can change it later).</li>
                        <li>AWS services are region-specific for latency, availability, and compliance reasons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>In short: Creating an AWS account gets you full access to AWS’s cloud services with a payment method on file, immediate ability to use the Free Tier, and the root account to manage everything. But you’re responsible for managing security and costs moving forward.</p>
