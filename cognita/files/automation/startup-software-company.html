            <ul>
                <li>Who pays? (end users, businesses, advertisers, etc.)</li>
                <li>What do they pay for? (access to software, features, support, ads, etc.)</li>
                <li>How do they pay? (one-time purchase, subscription, ads, freemium, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Awesome! When a startup software company earns through advertising, it basically monetizes its user base or platform by showing ads to users and getting paid by advertisers. Here’s how it typically works:</p>
            <h2>How Software Startups Earn from Advertising</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Build a User Base
                    <ul>
                        <li>You create a software product (like an app, website, or platform) that attracts and retains a large number of active users.</li>
                        <li>The more users and engagement you have, the more valuable your platform is to advertisers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Integrate Ads into the Product
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Display ads within your software interface — for example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Banner ads on a website or app.</li>
                                <li>Video ads before/during content.</li>
                                <li>Sponsored content or native ads that blend with your platform.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ads can be served through advertising networks like Google AdSense, Facebook Audience Network, or direct deals with advertisers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Monetization Models in Advertising
                    <ul>

                        <li>Cost Per Mille (CPM): You get paid per 1,000 ad impressions (views).</li>
                        <li>Cost Per Action (CPA): You get paid when users take a specific action after clicking (like signing up or purchasing).</li>
                        <li>Sponsored Content or Partnerships: Companies pay to promote their content or brand inside your software.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Balance ads with user experience to avoid overwhelming users and losing them.</li>
                        <li>Experiment with ad placements, formats, and types.</li>
