            <h2>Here are its key characteristics:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Command-line Shell:</b> It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with your computer, similar to other shells like Bash or Zsh, but with a focus on object-oriented programming.</li>
                <li><b>Scripting Language:</b> PowerShell includes a powerful scripting language built on the .NET framework, allowing for the automation of complex administrative tasks, system management, and solution deployment.</li>
                <li><b>Configuration Management:</b> PowerShell's Desired State Configuration (DSC) framework enables system administrators to define and maintain the desired state of their servers and other infrastructure components.</li>
                <li><b>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</b> Modern PowerShell (simply referred to as PowerShell) is open-source and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile tool for managing diverse environments.</li>
                <li><b>Object-Oriented Pipeline:</b> Unlike traditional shells that process text streams, PowerShell uses an object-oriented approach, allowing commands to pass objects (structured data) through a pipeline, which enhances automation capabilities.</li>
                <li><b>Cmdlets:</b> The core commands in PowerShell are called cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets"), which are specialized .NET classes designed to perform specific functions.</li>
            </ul>
