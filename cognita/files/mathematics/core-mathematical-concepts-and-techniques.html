                    <p class="subtitle">That’s a great question — and it’s surprisingly deep. Mathematics isn’t just about solving equations; it’s a language for reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding how the world works. Here’s a structured overview of core mathematical concepts and techniques that everyone should know, grouped by domain and importance.</p>

                <li>Exponents and roots: powers, squares, square roots, and how growth works (e.g., compound interest, exponential decay).</li>
                <li>Estimation and mental math: rounding, approximations, sanity-checking results.</li>
                <li>Mathematical logic: understanding “if–then” reasoning, negation, and proof by contradiction.</li>
