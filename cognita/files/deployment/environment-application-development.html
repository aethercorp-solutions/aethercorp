            <h2>Common Types of Environments:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Development Environment (Dev)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used by developers to write and test code.</li>
                        <li>Often has debugging tools and minimal security restrictions.</li>
                        <li>Can be on a local machine or a shared dev server.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Testing / QA Environment
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used by Quality Assurance teams to test features and check for bugs.</li>
                        <li>Mimics production but may use test data.</li>
                        <li>May include environments for unit tests, integration tests, or user acceptance testing (UAT).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Staging Environment
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mirror of production, used for final testing before deployment.</li>
                        <li>Helps ensure the code works correctly in a production-like setting.</li>
                        <li>Often includes the same configurations and databases as production.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Production Environment (Prod)
                    <ul>
                        <li>The live environment where the application is accessible to end users.</li>
                        <li>Requires high stability, performance, and security.</li>
                        <li>Changes here are carefully managed and monitored.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Use Multiple Environments?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Isolate issues: Bugs can be caught early in dev or test environments.</li>
                <li>Safe deployments: Code is tested thoroughly before going live.</li>
                <li>Team collaboration: Developers, testers, and stakeholders can work in parallel.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Example:</h2>
            <p>If you're building a web app, you might have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A dev environment running on your laptop (e.g., localhost:3000)</li>
                <li>A QA environment for testers (e.g., qa.myapp.com)</li>
                <li>A staging environment for final approval (e.g., staging.myapp.com)</li>
                <li>A production environment for users (e.g., www.myapp.com)</li>
            </ul>
