                    <p class="subtitle">Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers or resources. The goal is to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload on any single server.</p>

            <h2>Why is Load Balancing Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves availability and reliability by distributing workload across multiple servers.</li>
                <li>Enhances scalability as new servers can be added without downtime.</li>
                <li>Prevents server overload, reducing the risk of crashes or slowdowns.</li>
                <li>Ensures better user experience by reducing latency and response time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Types of Load Balancing</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices designed for load balancing.</li>
                <li>Software Load Balancers: Programs running on general-purpose servers (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy).</li>
                <li>DNS Load Balancing: Using DNS to distribute requests by resolving to different IPs.</li>
                <li>Cloud Load Balancing: Managed services provided by cloud providers (AWS ELB, Azure LB, Google Cloud LB).</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Common Load Balancing Algorithms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Round Robin: Distributes requests sequentially.</li>
                <li>Least Connections: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.</li>
                <li>IP Hash: Routes based on client IP address.</li>
                <li>Weighted Round Robin: Assigns requests based on server capacity (weight).</li>
                <li>Random: Randomly distributes requests.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Load Balancer Deployment Models</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Layer 4 (Transport Layer): Balances traffic based on TCP/UDP information.</li>
                <li>Layer 7 (Application Layer): Balances traffic based on application data (HTTP headers, cookies, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
