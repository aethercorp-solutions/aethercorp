            <h2>Key Concepts of a Cloud Environment:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Virtualized Infrastructure: Instead of physical hardware, cloud environments use virtual machines and containers that can be scaled and managed dynamically.</li>
                <li>On-Demand Resource Access: Users can provision and de-provision resources like servers and storage as needed.</li>
                <li>Pay-as-You-Go Model: You typically pay only for the resources you use.</li>
                <li>High Availability and Scalability: Cloud environments are designed for uptime and can automatically scale to meet demand.</li>
                <li>Managed Services: Many services (e.g., databases, machine learning, DevOps tools) are fully managed, reducing the need for in-house infrastructure management.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let's dive deeper into one of those cloud-native concepts.</p>
            <p>Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the three you mentioned‚ÄîContainers, Kubernetes, and Serverless‚Äîso you can decide which you'd like to explore in depth:</p>
            <h2>üîπ 1. Containers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What it is: Containers package your application code with all its dependencies, libraries, and settings into a single unit.</li>
                <li>Why it matters: They ensure your app runs the same across different environments‚Äîfrom development to production.</li>
                <li>Popular tool: Docker.</li>
                <li>
                    Key benefits:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What it is: Containers package your application code with all its dependencies, libraries, and settings into a single unit.</li>
                        <li>Why it matters: They ensure your app runs the same across different environments‚Äîfrom development to production.</li>
                        <li>Popular tool: Docker.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>üîπ 2. Kubernetes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What it is: An open-source platform for managing containers at scale (aka container orchestration)</li>
                <li>Why it matters: While containers are great, running dozens or hundreds of them manually is a nightmare. Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, networking, and health checking of containerized apps.</li>
                <li>
                    Key features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Auto-scaling and self-healing</li>
                        <li>Service discovery and load balancing</li>
                        <li>Rolling updates and rollbacks</li>
                        <li>Multi-cloud/hybrid deployments</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>üîπ 3. Serverless Computing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What it is: A cloud computing model where you write code and the cloud provider handles all infrastructure management.</li>
                <li>Why it matters: You don‚Äôt manage servers‚Äîyou just deploy functions. You only pay when your code runs.</li>
                <li>
                    Popular examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AWS Lambda</li>
                        <li>Azure Functions</li>
                        <li>Google Cloud Functions</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Best for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Event-driven workloads (e.g., API calls, file uploads, cron jobs)</li>
                        <li>Lightweight microservices</li>
                        <li>Rapid development with low ops overhead</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>üì¶ Containers (e.g., Docker, images, volumes, registries)</li>
                <li>‚öôÔ∏è Kubernetes (e.g., pods, deployments, clusters, services)</li>
                <li>‚ö° Serverless (e.g., function-as-a-service, triggers, scaling, use cases)</li>
            </ul>
