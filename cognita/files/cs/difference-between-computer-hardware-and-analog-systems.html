            <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system — the parts you can see and touch.</p>
            <h2>🧠 Main Categories of Hardware:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>CPU (Central Processing Unit): the “brain” of the computer</li>
                        <li>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): handles visual and graphic processing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Storage Devices – save data and programs
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examples: hard drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD), USB flash drive</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Memory – temporarily stores data while the computer runs
                    <ul>
                        <li>RAM (Random Access Memory): short-term working memory</li>
                        <li>ROM (Read-Only Memory): stores permanent instructions (like startup info)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Motherboard – main circuit board connecting all components</li>
                <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU) – provides power to all hardware parts</li>
            </ol>

            <p>💡 In short:</p>
            <p>Computer hardware = the physical body of the computer,
                while software = the instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.</p>

        <section>
            <p>Analog systems are systems that work with continuous signals — meaning the data or information they handle changes smoothly and gradually over time, not in discrete steps like digital systems.</p>
            <h2>⚙️ Definition</h2>
            <p>An analog system processes or represents information using physical quantities that vary continuously, such as voltage, current, sound, or temperature.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🎛️ Examples</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Old radios and televisions – use continuous electrical signals to produce sound or images.</li>
                <li>Thermometers with mercury – show temperature as a continuous movement of the mercury column.</li>
                <li>Analog clocks – the hands move smoothly around the dial.</li>
                <li>Vinyl record players – the grooves on the record produce continuous sound waves.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A continuous signal is a type of signal that varies smoothly over time — it can take any value at any point in time.</p>
            <h2>💡 In simple terms:</h2>
            <p>A continuous signal changes without jumps or gaps, like a smooth curve.</p>
            <h2>🧩 Example:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Analog clock: The hands move smoothly — time flows continuously.</li>
                <li>Sound wave: When you speak, the air pressure changes gradually, not in steps.</li>
                <li>Temperature: The temperature throughout the day changes continuously, not instantly from 25°C to 30°C.</li>
            </ul>
