            <h2>🧠 1. Linguistic or grammatical patterns</h2>
            <p>These are recurring structures in how words are combined.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subject + Verb + Object → “She eats apples.”</li>
                <li>Adjective + Noun → “blue sky”</li>
                <li>Verb + Preposition + Noun → “look at me”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Used in grammar learning or natural language processing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔤 2. Word formation patterns</h2>
            <p>These describe how new words are created.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prefixation: un- + happy → unhappy</li>
                <li>Suffixation: teach + -er → teacher</li>
                <li>Compounding: book + store → bookstore</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🧩 3. Semantic patterns</h2>
            <p>Words that appear together often and form meaningful relationships (collocations).</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“make a decision” (not “do a decision”)</li>
                <li>“strong tea” (not “powerful tea”)</li>
                <li>“fast food” (not “quick food”)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Used in language models and search engines to detect meaning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔍 4. Textual or statistical word patterns</h2>
            <p>Patterns found by analyzing frequency or sequence of words.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>N-grams (like “I am”, “am going”, “going to”)</li>
                <li>Repeated phrases in documents</li>
                <li>Sentiment words (e.g., good, happy, love → positive)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Used in machine learning, NLP, and data mining.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🎨 5. Creative or stylistic word patterns</h2>
            <p>Intentional repetition, rhythm, or structure for artistic effect.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alliteration: “Peter Piper picked…”</li>
                <li>Parallelism: “Easy come, easy go.”</li>
                <li>Repetition: “Never, never, never give up.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Used in poetry, speeches, and branding.</p>

            <p>Would you like me to focus on linguistic, data/text analysis, or creative writing patterns?</p>
            <p>Got it 👍 — just to clarify, which kind of word patterns do you want to focus on?</p>
            <p>Here are your options again:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>🧠 Linguistic / Grammar patterns – how words are structured in sentences</li>
                <li>🔤 Word formation patterns – prefixes, suffixes, root combinations</li>
                <li>🧩 Semantic / Meaning patterns – how words commonly appear together</li>
                <li>🔍 Data or text analysis patterns – statistical or AI-based word trends</li>
                <li>🎨 Creative / Literary patterns – poetic, rhetorical, or stylistic uses</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>✍️ 5. Pattern Mixing</h2>
            <p>Writers and speakers often combine patterns for richer sentences:</p>
            <p>“After she finished her work (complex clause), she called her friend (S + V + O), and they talked for hours (compound structure).”</p>
            <p>👉 This mix gives flow and variation in natural language.</p>
