                    <p class="subtitle">Vacuum tubes (also called electron tubes or thermionic valves) are electronic devices that control the flow of electric current in a vacuum inside a sealed glass or metal tube. They were widely used in early computers, radios, televisions, and amplifiers before the invention of transistors.</p>

            <p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>
            <h2>🧩 Basic Principle</h2>
            <p>A vacuum tube controls current using electrons emitted by a heated cathode:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The cathode is heated (usually by a filament), causing it to release electrons (a process called thermionic emission).</li>
                <li>These electrons travel through the vacuum toward a positively charged anode (plate).</li>
                <li>By adding control elements (like grids), you can regulate this electron flow — this is how the tube amplifies or switches signals.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>⚙️ Main Parts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cathode – emits electrons when heated.</li>
                <li>Anode (plate) – collects electrons, completing the circuit.</li>
                <li>Filament (heater) – heats the cathode.</li>
                <li>
                    Grids – control or modify electron flow:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Control grid – adjusts current (used for amplification).</li>
                        <li>Screen and suppressor grids – improve performance and reduce interference.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔌 Common Types</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Diode tube – 2 elements (cathode and anode); used for rectification.</li>
                <li>Triode – 3 elements (adds a control grid); used for amplification.</li>
                <li>Tetrode and Pentode – 4 or 5 elements; used for higher gain and better performance.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>📻 Applications (historical and modern)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Early computers (e.g., ENIAC)</li>
                <li>Radio and TV receivers</li>
                <li>Audio amplifiers</li>
                <li>Radar and transmitters</li>
                <li>High-end audio equipment (modern audiophiles still use vacuum tube amplifiers for their “warm” sound)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A vacuum tube (also called an electron tube or valve) is an electronic device that controls the flow of electric current inside a sealed glass or metal tube that has most of the air removed — that’s why it’s called a vacuum tube.</p>
            <p>It was one of the first electronic components used to make radios, televisions, and early computers work, before the invention of the transistor.</p>
        
            <h2>🧩 Basic Idea</h2>
            <p>Inside the vacuum tube:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electrons move through empty space (a vacuum) from one metal part to another.</li>
                <li>By controlling how those electrons flow, the tube can amplify signals, switch currents, or generate waves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>⚙️ Main Parts of a Simple Vacuum Tube (Triode):</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cathode (–) – Heated to release electrons.</li>
                <li>Anode (Plate) (+) – Attracts the electrons.</li>
                <li>Grid (Control Grid) – Controls the number of electrons flowing between cathode and anode.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When you apply a small voltage to the grid, it can control a larger current between the cathode and anode, which allows amplification.</p>

            <h2>📻 In Simple Terms</h2>
            <p>Think of a vacuum tube as an early version of a transistor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It can turn a current on or off (like a switch).</li>
                <li>It can make weak signals stronger (like an amplifier).</li>
            </ul>
