            <h2>🔹 1. Statements</h2>
            <p>A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is either true or false, but not both.</p>

            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"2 + 2 = 4" → ✅ True statement</li>
                <li>"5 is an even number" → ❌ False statement</li>
                <li>"x + 3" → ❌ Not a statement (it's an expression)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🔹 2. Types of Reasoning</h2>
            <p>➤ Deductive Reasoning</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starts with general rules and applies them to specific cases.</li>
                <li>Used in proofs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code>
All humans are mortal.
Socrates is a human.
⇒ Socrates is mortal.
            </code></pre>

            <p>➤ Inductive Reasoning</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses specific examples to find general patterns.</li>
                <li>Not always 100% certain.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code>
2 is even, 4 is even, 6 is even...
⇒ All even numbers are divisible by 2.
            </code></pre>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Affirming the Consequent:
                    <p>P ⇒ Q and Q is true, so P is true (❌ invalid)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Denying the Antecedent:
                    <p>P ⇒ Q and P is false, so Q is false (❌ invalid)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🧠 Example:</h2>
            <pre><code>
Statement 1 (Given):
All even numbers are divisible by 2. ✅

Statement 2 (Given):
8 is an even number. ✅

Conclusion (Using reasoning):
Therefore, 8 is divisible by 2. ✅
            </code></pre>

            <p>Why is this reasoning?</p>
            <p>You're applying a general rule (all even numbers are divisible by 2) to a specific case (8 is an even number) to reach a logical conclusion (8 is divisible by 2).</p>
            <p>This is a simple direct proof using deductive reasoning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Great! Let's go through a few very basic examples of different types of mathematical reasoning:</p>
            <h2>🔹 1. Direct Proof (Deductive Reasoning)</h2>

            <p><b>Statement:</b></p>
            <p>If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2.</p>

            <p><b>Proof:</b></p>
            <pre><code>
Let’s say we take the number 10.
10 is even because it can be written as 2 × 5.
Therefore, 10 is divisible by 2.
            </code></pre>

            <p>✅ Conclusion: The statement holds true.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔹 2. Proof by Contrapositive</h2>
            <p><b>Statement:</b></p>
            <p>If a number is not divisible by 2, then it is not even.</p>

            <p><b>Contrapositive:</b></p>
            <p>Instead of proving:</p>
            <p>P ⇒ Q → If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2</p>

            <p>We prove:</p>
            <p>¬Q ⇒ ¬P → If a number is not divisible by 2, then it is not even</p>

            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code>
Take 7.
7 is not divisible by 2.
Therefore, 7 is not even.
            </code></pre>

            <p>✅ Contrapositive is true → So the original statement is also true.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔹 3. Proof by Contradiction</h2>
            <p><b>Statement:</b></p>
            <p>There is no smallest positive rational number.</p>

            <p><b>Assume the opposite (for contradiction):</b></p>
            <p>Suppose there is a smallest positive rational number, say 𝑟.</p>

            <p>Now consider r/2​, which is also a positive rational number, and smaller than 𝑟</p>
            <p>This contradicts our assumption that 𝑟 r is the smallest.</p>
            <p>❌ So our assumption is false.</p>
            <p>✅ Conclusion: There is no smallest positive rational number.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>🔹 4. Inductive Reasoning</h2>
            <p><b>Statement (Pattern Guessing):</b></p>
            <p>The sum of the first few odd numbers seems to form a pattern.</p>

            <p>Let’s test:</p>
            <pre><code>
1 = 1
1 + 3 = 4
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
            </code></pre>

            <p>Looks like:</p>
            <p>1 → 1^2,  4 → 2^2,  9 → 3^2,  16 → 4^2</p>
            <p>Guess (Induction):</p>
            <p>Sum of first 𝑛 odd numbers = 𝑛^2</p>
            <p>This is not a proof yet, but inductive reasoning helps us discover the pattern.</p>

            <h2>What is irrational number</h2>
            <p>An irrational number is a type of real number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers — that is, it cannot be written in the form:</p>
            <p>a/b</p>

            <p>where 𝑎 a and 𝑏 b are integers and 𝑏 ≠ 0 b  =0.</p>
            <p>Key Characteristics of Irrational Numbers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their decimal representation goes on forever and does not repeat.</li>
                <li>They cannot be written exactly as a simple fraction.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <ul>
                <li>𝜋 π (pi) ≈ 3.1415926535…</li>

            <h2>Contrast with Rational Numbers:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rational: Can be expressed as fractions (e.g., 3/4, -2, 0.5)</li>
                <li>Irrational: Cannot be expressed as fractions (e.g., √3, π)</li>
