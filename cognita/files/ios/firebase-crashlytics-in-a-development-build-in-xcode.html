            <h2>‚úÖ Using Crashlytics in Development (Dev) Builds ‚Äì What You Need to Know</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Crashlytics Works in Dev Mode
                    <p>Crashlytics will report crashes and non-fatal issues in development builds. This is helpful for debugging and testing before production releases.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Symbolication Still Happens
                    <p>As long as you're uploading your dSYM files (which Xcode usually does automatically with the Firebase SDK), the crashes will be symbolicated just like in release builds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set a Custom Build Type / Environment
                    <p>To help differentiate dev vs prod crashes in the Crashlytics dashboard, it‚Äôs a good idea to set a custom key or log:</p>
                    <pre><code>
Crashlytics.crashlytics().setCustomValue("development", forKey: "build_environment")
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Or:</p>
                    <pre><code>
Crashlytics.crashlytics().log("Running development build")
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Force a Test Crash
                    <p>To verify it's working in dev, you can force a test crash:</p>
                    <pre><code>
Crashlytics.crashlytics().log("Testing crash in dev")
fatalError("Test crash for dev build")
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crashes May Not Appear Instantly
                    <p>Crash reports are not sent immediately ‚Äî they are sent on the next app launch after a crash, and it can take a few minutes for them to show up in the Firebase Console.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make Sure Debug Symbols Are Uploaded
                    <p>For dev builds, Debug Info must be present. If symbolication isn‚Äôt working:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check that DWARF with dSYM File is set in Build Settings.</li>
                        <li>Ensure dSYMs are uploaded (automatic with Firebase Run Script).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Only Enable in Certain Schemes</h2>
            <p>If you only want to use Crashlytics in certain environments, you can guard it:</p>
            <pre><code>
#if DEBUG
Crashlytics.crashlytics().setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(true)
#endif
            </code></pre>

            <p>Or use build configurations and environment variables.</p>

            <p>Great question ‚Äî the term "release build" can mean different things depending on context. Let's break it down:</p>
            <h2>‚úÖ What Is a Release Build?</h2>
            <p>In the context of iOS development with Xcode, a release build typically refers to a version of your app built using the Release configuration, as opposed to the Debug configuration.</p>
            <p>üì¶ 1. "Release Build" (Technical Definition in Xcode)</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In Xcode, there are usually two build configurations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Debug ‚Üí used for development, with extra logs, debugger support, etc.</li>
                        <li>Release ‚Üí optimized for performance, with debugging disabled.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can view/edit these in:
                    <pre><code>
Xcode > Project > Build Settings > Configurations
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, a release build is just:</p>
            <p>A version of the app built using the Release configuration ‚Äî usually for TestFlight, App Store, or production use.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>üì§ 2. Is a Release Build Only One Uploaded to the App Store?</h2>
            <p>No. A release build doesn't have to be uploaded to the App Store. It could also be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uploaded to TestFlight</li>
                <li>Shared with testers via ad hoc distribution</li>
                <li>Installed locally with tools like Xcode Organizer or Diawi</li>
                <li>Shared using Firebase App Distribution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The key is: if the app was built using the Release configuration, it‚Äôs considered a release build, regardless of whether it‚Äôs live on the App Store.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>üß™ 3. What About Dev Builds?</h2>
            <p>Dev (development) builds are typically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built with the Debug configuration</li>
                <li>Run locally in the Simulator or on a connected device via Xcode</li>
                <li>Have debugging and logging enabled</li>
                <li>Not optimized for performance</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>üî• Crashlytics & Release vs Dev</h2>
            <p>Firebase Crashlytics works with both:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Build Type</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Crashlytics</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Debug Build</td>
                        <td>Built for development/testing in Xcode</td>
                        <td>‚úÖ Yes (optional)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Release Build</td>
                        <td>Built for distribution (TestFlight/App Store)</td>
                        <td>‚úÖ Yes (default)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>You can enable Crashlytics selectively based on your build type if needed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>"Release build" = any build using the Release configuration (not necessarily App Store).</li>
                <li>Crashlytics works in both dev and release builds.</li>
                <li>Use setCustomValue() or flags to track what environment a crash came from.</li>
