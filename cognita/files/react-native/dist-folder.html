            <h2>Key Points:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ✅ Minified and optimized files: The contents are usually minified (smaller in size), often including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS (possibly from SASS/SCSS or LESS)</li>
                        <li>JavaScript (often bundled from many modules)</li>
                        <li>Images or other assets (compressed or optimized)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    ✅ Generated by build tools like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Webpack</li>
                        <li>Vite</li>
                        <li>Rollup</li>
                        <li>Parcel</li>
                        <li>or frameworks like Angular, React, Vue (e.g., using npm run build)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    ✅ Static files only — no source code, no development tools, just what's needed to run the site in the browser.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>Let’s say you have a React project with source code in /src.</p>
            <p>When you run:</p>
            <pre><code>
npm run build
            </code></pre>

            <p>You might get a /dist (or sometimes /build) folder that contains:</p>
            <pre><code>
dist/
├── index.html
├── main.abc123.js
├── style.abc123.css
├── assets/
            </code></pre>
            <p>These are the files you upload to your server or host on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The dist folder is the final product of your website or app — clean, efficient, and ready to go live. It's not meant to be edited, only served.</p>
